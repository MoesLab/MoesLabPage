              Internet of Things is here now, they are all over the place,
              and new ones with more capabilities and speed showing up because the hardware is
              getting less expensive and can do more in a small package, we owe that to the
              evolution of SoCs and availabilities of the cloud platforms. To understand and
              get familiar with some of the aspects of this technology
              I have moved up my sleeves to create and program a bunch of them
              and run them against multi-cloud platforms. I am presenting a demo
              of them in this Vlog.

              Around the year 2010, I have decided to challenge myself with a full-blown
              project that can be fun and educational so I will improve my skills in
              three disciplines: Embedded programming, Electronics, and Mechanic.
              There are two more successful revisions that have been built since then
              and the adventure is still continuing.

            <p>
              Since my childhood when I was buying, playing, and learning RC toys
              till now which my toys getting more serious and challenging,
              I know that two things have been changed first the cost of them
              and second my abilities to make them. The following section will
              present some of my serious Robots (quad-copters, rovers, and boats)
              that are capable of finding and going through preplanned waypoints
              using today's technology that way I can take video and picture shots.
