            IoT Demo 2020
          </h2>
          <p>
            Internet of things is here now, they are all over the place,
            and new ones with more capabilities and speed showing up because the hardware
            getting more inexpensive and can do more in a small package, we owe that to the
            evolution of SoCs and availabilities of the cloud platforms. To understand and
            get familiar with some of the aspects of this technology
            I have moved up my sleeves to create and program a bunch of them
            and run them against multi-cloud platforms. I will present a demo
            of them in the following Vlog.

          <p>
            Around the year 2010, I have decided to challenge myself with a full-blown
            project that can be fun and educational so I will improve my skills in
            three disciplines: Embedded programming, Electronics, and Mechanic.
            There are two more successful revisions that have been built since then
            and the adventure is still continuing.

            Autonomous Robots
          </h2>
          <p>
            Since my childhood when I was buying, playing, and learning RC toys
            till now which my toys getting more serious and challenging,
            I know that two things have been changed first the cost of them
            and second my abilities to make them. The following section will
            present some of my serious Robots (quad-copters, rovers, and boats)
            that are capable of finding and going through preplanned waypoints
            using today's technology that way I can take video and picture shots.
